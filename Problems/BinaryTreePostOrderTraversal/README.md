### Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Example:
```bash
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [3,2,1]
```

### Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
