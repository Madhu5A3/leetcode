### Hamming Distance

### Problem Statement
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a> between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers **x** and **y**, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ **x, y** < 231.

### Example:
```bash
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
