### Permutation Sequence

### Problem Statement
The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
```bash
"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
```

<code>Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.</code>

### Note:
<code>
Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
</code>

### Example 1:
```bash
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```
### Example 2:
```bash
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
