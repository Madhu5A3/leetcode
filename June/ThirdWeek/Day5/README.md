### Longest Duplicate Substring

### Problem Statement
Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)
Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)

### Example 1:
```bash
Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
```

### Example 2:

```bash
Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
``` 

### Note:
<code>2 <= S.length <= 10^5</code>
<code>S consists of lowercase English letters.</code>
